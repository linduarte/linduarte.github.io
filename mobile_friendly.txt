Select CSS media query breakpoints.
One way to build responsive web design is to use CSS media queries
to create different layouts for different screen sizes.
Choose the breakpoints, or widths, at which you want to change 
the layout. A good starting point is 320px, 480px, 768px, and 1024px
resolutions. Next, you'll create different CSS rules for each
breakpoint. For example, you might have one set of rules for
screens that are 320px wide and another for screens that are 768px
wide. Finally, you'll use the @media rule to optimize the code for
each screen size.

Define typography. Creating responsive typography allows the font 
to adjust to the user's screen. For example, this HTML code line 
ensures the typography adjusts to and fits whichever screen size it displays on.
html { font-size:100%; }
You can also add the @media tag to define the font size for
various resolutions. Adding the @media CSS tag wíll help improve
responsiveness by adjusting the site’s content to the various
content screen sizes. The min-width property allows you to set
the minimum size for the content. Setting the min-width to 
640 pexels (px) automatically adjusts smaller contents
(less than 640px) to expand to 640px.

Another important element to note is the rem tag which defines
the size of the content. The Rem (also called root em) unit is
a standard unit for measuring the font size of elements.
For example, 1rem equals 16px while 1.5 rem converts to 24px.

@media (min-width:640px) { body {font-size:1rem;} }
@media (min-width:960px) { body {font-size:1.2rem;} }
@media (min-width:1100px) { body {font-size:1.5rem;} }
